Data Analysis on New York Mets Hitter Evaluation
Project Summary

This project explores whether high-paid baseball players are truly overrated by analyzing the relationship between salary and performance. Using player statistics across positions, I examined efficiency through WAR (Wins Above Replacement), OPS+, and salary metrics.

Performance Analysis: WAR showed the strongest link with OPS+ (r = 0.82). Outfielders had the highest average WAR (2.8), and the peak performance age was 26–29. Contact rate influenced success 15% more than Power-Speed, emphasizing consistency over power.

Salary Efficiency: Average cost per WAR was $4.2 M, with younger players (23–25) showing the best value. Veterans (32+) were 40% less efficient, while outfielders had the largest salary variance ($5.8 M).

Optimization Impact: Reallocating contracts could save $45.2 M (18% of total payroll) and improve team WAR by +3.2, mainly through optimizing outfield and infield positions.

Although centered on baseball, this framework demonstrates how data can quantify value and efficiency — an approach equally relevant to understanding compensation and performance in other industries.
